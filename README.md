# Chapter 2: Annotating Images and Videos with an Object Detection API

## Description
This chapter details the project about building a real-time object detection application that can annotate images, videos and webcam captures using the new Tensorflowâ€™s Object Detection API (and its selection of pre-trained convolutional networks, the so-called Tensorflow detection model zoo) and OpenCV. The chapter depicts step to step building of such a real-time object recognition by using small reusable projects that can become the building blocks of other different projects. The reader is introduced to pre-trained models and shown the practical advantages in terms of the trade-off precision versus speed when using each of them. The complete project will make the reader able to annotate many images from the Coco dataset (http://mscoco.org/) and any image processed by her/his own webcam.

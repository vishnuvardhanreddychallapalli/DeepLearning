## Description
This project is about building a real-time object detection application that can annotate images, videos and webcam captures using the new Tensorflowâ€™s Object Detection API (and its selection of pre-trained convolutional networks, the so-called Tensorflow detection model zoo) and OpenCV. The project depicts step to step building of such a real-time object recognition. The complete project done on the Coco dataset (http://mscoco.org/) and some images processed by my own webcam.

## Tools used
* Tensorflow Object Detection API
* OpenCV
* Real-time image processing
